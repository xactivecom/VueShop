# TypeScript Demo
Example based on content from the Vue Mastery course "Intro to Vue 3 + TypeScript".
The courses use the Vue Composition API syntax with TypeScript.

https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/vue3-typescript

### Approach
Instead of following the slightly dated course approach, instead the Vite tool was
used to start the project. The result is that the project config files do not match
the old code repository.

From the root folder, create vite-based project:
```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

Prompts
-	Project name: vue-typescript
-	Framework: Vue
-	Variant: TypeScript

```bash
cd vue-typescript
npm install
```

### Vite Notes
This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about the recommended Project Setup and IDE Support in the [Vue Docs TypeScript Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#project-setup).
